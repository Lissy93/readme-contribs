## About

### Motivation

It's nice to give credit to contributors and supporters who've helped your project üíû

But using GitHub Actions to generate these causes your commit history to become unnecessarily cluttered. And existing services to embed contributor widgets aren't very customizable and don't support sponsors or stargazers.

My aim with this project, is to provide an easy way for you to embed your projects contributors, sponsors, stargazers, etc, and to let you configure the look and feel. You can also easily deploy this project to Vercel, so you'll never need to worry about the managed instance becoming unavailable. 

---

## Usage

### Embedding
To embed the image in your markdown, simply use the endpoint as the image URL.<br />
For example:

```
![Sponsors](https://readme-contribs.as93.net/sponsors/lissy93)
```

### Base Domain
The following API routes are to be made from the base domain.<br />
For the public instance, use `https://readme-contribs.as93.net`.<br />
If you're hosting your own instance, update this to your domain.<br />

### Embed Contributors

```
/contributors/[user]/[repo]
```


### Embed Sponsors

```
/sponsors/[user]
```


### Embed Stargazers

```
/stargazers/[user]/[repo]
```


### Embed Forkers

```
/sponsors/[user]/[repo]
```

### Image Options
